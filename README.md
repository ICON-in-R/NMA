# NMA

Two ways to obtain the code are

* download the zip file by clicking on green `code` button above.
* download git and then open git bash where you want to download the package and type `git clone https://github.com/n8thangreen/NMA.git`.

Build and attach the package to use.
To run the analysis use the `scripts/run_analysis.R` script.


#### TODO
I will refactor this code to be much more robust and clear when I get the time.
