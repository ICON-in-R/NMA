# NMA

Its probably easiest to download the zip file by clicking on green `code` button above.

The code works for me by running the following scripts in this order:

* 3_LoadFunction_Survival.R
* NMA.R
* plotNetwork.R
* 4_RunAnalysis_Survival.R

I will refactor this code to be much more robust and clear when I get the time.
